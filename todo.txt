MVP todo:



func:

pic fields should be urls or file upload
response post should return to the blurb page?
links should open in new page


rather than clicking a button to see responses, what if the div was highlighted if responses exist? then the whole thing is a link to expand?


next steps functionally:
search function: tags, users
add "follow" or "connect" functionally
blurbs of those you follow look diff.
add groups

add weekly advice post

try to add responses to responses

new model: my stuff. it contains all blurbs, and groups randomized.
