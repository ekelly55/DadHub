MVP todo:



func:




]



create/edit profile: these are form as p, so will take some work to redo. is it worth it?


rather than clicking a button to see responses, what if the div was highlighted if responses exist? then the whole thing is a link to expand?


next steps functionally:
search function: tags, users
add "follow" or "connect" functionally
blurbs of those you follow look diff.
add groups

add weekly advice post

try to add responses to responses

new model: my stuff. it contains all blurbs, and groups randomized.
